- [**Agile Web Development =>**](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/agile-web-development/) *broad category of methodologies based on the principles outlined in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development, which was compiled by a team of professional developers in 2001. Specific methods such a scrum and XP are considered agile although they existed before the manifesto was written* 

- [**Markdown =>**](https://markdown.es/) *Markdownâ€™s syntax is intended for one purpose: to be used as a format for writing for the web.*

- [**Git, GitFlow y Github =>**](course/Conceptos/git) *Git is a free and open source distributed version control system*

- [**Jasmine =>**](https://jasmine.github.io/2.9/introduction) *TDD (*Test Driven Development*)*

- [**JavaScript =>**](course/Conceptos/js) *is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.*

    - **Objects, variables, arrays, functions**
    - **Hositing =>** *Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top*
    - **Memoization =>** *is a programming technique which attempts to increase a function's performance by caching its previously computed results*
    - **Polyfills =>** *A polyfill is a browser fallback, made in JavaScript, that allows functionality you expect to work in modern browsers to work in older browsers.*
    - **Prototypes =>** *Every JavaScript object has a prototype. The prototype is also an object. All JavaScript objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype.* 
    - **this & binding =>**  *Usually we apply bind to fix 'this' in an object method, so that we can pass it somewhere.*
    - **High Order Functions =>** *A higher-order function is a function that can take another function as an argument, or that returns a function as a result*
